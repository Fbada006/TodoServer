# TodoServer
This is a TODO server built purely in kotlin using the awesome Ktor and PostgreSQL.
This code is based on the tutorial of the awesome [raywenderlich](https://www.raywenderlich.com/7265034-ktor-rest-api-for-mobile). If you have any problems setting up PostgreSQL on windows, then [this](https://medium.com/@aeadedoyin/getting-started-with-postgresql-on-windows-201906131300-ee75f066df78) can help you.
Enjoy!
